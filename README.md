## Date:22/10/25
## Reg. No. 212222210006

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

***

## **Procedure:**

1. **Introduction to Prompt Patterns:**  
   Understand and apply the following prompt patterns:
   - **Decision-Making Prompts:** Guide the model to select between multiple business strategies or investment options.
   - **Comparative Prompts:** Direct the model to compare markets, companies, or strategies using a structured framework.
   - **SWOT-Based Prompts:** Use Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to analyze business scenarios.
   - **Query Decomposition:** Break down complex business topics into smaller focus areas like finance, competition, and growth.
   - **Semantic Filtering:** Adjust tone and professionalism by specifying the communication style (formal, analytical, executive-level, etc.).

2. **Choosing the Content Type:**  
   Select a content type suitable for business communication:
   - **Business Reports** (e.g., market feasibility studies, growth reports)  
   - **Case Studies** (e.g., company success, product innovation)

3. **Creating the Prompts:**
   - Start with **simple prompts** to generate initial ideas.  
   - Then, apply **structured prompt techniques** to deepen the analysis (e.g., ask for a comparative table, decision rationale, or SWOT analysis).

4. **Generating and Refining Outputs:**
   - Generate the **first draft** using open-ended prompts.
   - Refine by specifying structure, perspective, and decision criteria.
   - Re-prompt with requests for analytical frameworks, factual tone, or professional insights.

5. **Evaluation of the Outputs:**
   Review and assess:
   - **Coherence:** Logical flow of business analysis.
   - **Analytical Depth:** Presence of facts, reasoning, and evaluation.
   - **Tone and Style:** Formal and suitable for business context.
   - **Practical Relevance:** Usefulness of insights for decision-making.

## **Test Case Scenarios:**
For demonstration, two scenarios are presented using different prompt patterns.

### **Test Case 1: Business Report on Electric Vehicle Market Trends (Decision-Making Prompt)**

**Prompt:**  
“Analyze the feasibility of launching an electric vehicle startup in the Indian market. Evaluate factors like demand, government policies, and competition. Conclude whether entry is viable for a mid-sized investor.”

**Output (Refined):**  
India’s electric vehicle (EV) market shows strong growth potential due to increased fuel prices, government subsidies, and pollution concerns. With the FAME-II policy supporting EV manufacturing, startups can target affordable models for urban users. However, infrastructure gaps and high upfront costs pose challenges. Overall, the Indian EV market remains feasible for entry with medium investment and strategic partnerships.

### **Test Case 2: Case Study – Ola Electric’s Growth Strategy (SWOT + Comparative Prompt)**

**Prompt:**  
“Prepare a case study on Ola Electric’s business strategy. Include a SWOT analysis and a comparison with other Indian EV competitors like Ather Energy and Hero Electric.”

**Output (Refined):**  
Ola Electric’s vertically integrated manufacturing model and direct-to-consumer approach give it a cost advantage. Its marketing leverages brand identity from Ola Cabs, ensuring high brand recall.

**SWOT Analysis:**
- **Strengths:** Strong brand presence, large-scale automated factory, government subsidy benefits.  
- **Weaknesses:** Quality concerns, delayed deliveries.  
- **Opportunities:** Expanding into overseas markets, battery innovation.  
- **Threats:** Rising competition, uncertain regulatory environment.

**Comparative Insights:** Compared to Ather Energy’s technology-centric approach and Hero Electric’s mass-market pricing, Ola Electric combines scale and affordability, positioning itself between premium and budget EV segments.

## **Deliverables:**
1. **First Draft:** Generated using basic, unstructured prompts.
2. **Refined Content:** Expanded and structured through advanced prompt patterns (decision-making, SWOT-based, comparative prompts).
3. **Multiple Versions:** Iterative outputs showing how prompt structure improves professionalism and analytical clarity.
4. **Final Version:** Polished version with clear sections, improved tone, and factual context.

***

## **Observation:**
- Decision-making prompts improve logical organization and persuasive clarity.
- Comparative prompts produce balanced evaluations and market context.
- SWOT-based prompts ensure comprehensive analysis.
- Structured prompting gives the AI direction, reducing irrelevant or vague outputs.

***

## **Conclusion:**
Through this experiment, structured prompt engineering was shown to enhance the depth, coherence, and professional tone of business reports and case studies. Techniques like decision-making, comparative analysis, and SWOT framing help produce outputs that mirror real-world analytical frameworks. Prompt structure thus plays a crucial role in transforming generic AI content into decision-oriented business intelligence outputs.
